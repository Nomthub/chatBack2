#Task -Build a GraphQL API NodeJS

GraphQL is a query language and a server-side runtime (typically served  over HTTP). GraphQL is a language for querying data. Unlike most query languages (such as SQL), you don’t use GraphQL to query a particular type of data store (such as a MySQL database). Instead, you use GraphQL to query data from any number of different sources.

You have to create a GraphQL API by following the steps below
1.	Create a new project on your device and install the graphQL dependencies using the terminal
2.	Create a schema for startups in the index.js file
3.	Hardcode an array of startups you want to query on
4.	Now, you’ll create the ‘resolvers’ object and connect it to the hardcoded data
5.	Create the ‘ApolloServer’ instance in the end of app.js file
6.	Run using the command ‘node app’ and can use 'nodemon app'

The folder named server is the graphql API and the folder named chatter is the react API. 
The data is hardcoded to a vector.
